                The search for habitable planets besides our own has captivated humanity for decades. Whether driven 
                by curiosity about extraterrestrial life or the need for a potential future home, this pursuit has gained 
                urgency as Earth's resources face increasing strain. Climate change, pollution, and resource depletion 
                threaten the planet's habitability, while the distant future holds the inevitability of the Sun expanding 
                into a red giant, making Earth uninhabitable. NASA‚Äôs goal these days is to find unmistakable signs of 
                current life outside of Earth.

                Kepler space telescope was launched in 2009 with the purpose of searching for exoplanets, especially 
                those in the habitable zone of their stars. The spacecraft, although officially retired in 2018, collected 
                an immense amount of data which continues to be analysed to this day. This project focuses on 
                classifying Kepler‚Äôs objects of interest (KOIs) as either exoplanets, candidate of exoplanets, or false positives caused by phenomena like binary stars or noise.  

                This project develops a machine learning classification model to identify whether Kepler‚Äôs object of interest is 
                exoplanet, candidate of exoplanet, or not.

                A Kepler Object of Interest("**KOI**) is a star observed by the Kepler space

                Scientists configure three different categories based on Kepler's object of interest.

                through multiple independent methods or observations.

                - False Positive means that Kepler incorrectly identify its object to be exoplanet.

                The amount of energy from a star that reaches the surface of a planet or exoplanet (insolation flux)
                determines how habitable an exoplanet is. If the planet is close to its star, it will benefit from
                more energy but it will also has a hotter surface, making the planet too hot for life.
                However, if the planet is too far from its star, it will be too cold for form of life to exist.

                The ideal measurement to insolation flux of exoplanet is equal to 1. Insolation Flux = 1 means that
                the planet is receiving the same amount of energy as Earth does from the Sun. This is often used as
                a baseline for Earth-like conditions, and it could indicate that the planet is in the habitable zone
                of its star, similar to Earth.

                It's important to note that this analysis uses simplified measure (koi_insol) to determine whether an
                exoplanet is habitable or not. To fully understand if an exoplanet is habitable or not, there are
                several factors need to be measured. However, this analysis could serve as a preliminary analysis or assumption.
